How to use multiplayer:

To use multiplayer, you have to start a server first. This is done by the server button putting in the port
number and the number of players (e.g. 7777 as the port, 2 as the number of players)

After you've made the server, press connect to join it. If you're wanting multiple clients to join off the same
machine, use "localhost" as the ip and the port specified the server was created with. Otherwise, find the
local IP of the machine that the server was created and join off that.

It will hang for a bit until all the players have connected. (TODO: put a "waiting for players" message when 
the client has connected)
