Setting up the Project Workspace for JavaFX:

Eclipse has some problems with the JavaFX library (which is a default part of Java 8)
so in order to correctly set up our work environment, we need to change some things.

Step 1: Disable Errors with restricted access
	Go to Project > Properties > Java Compiler > Errors/Warnings
	You may either check "Project specific settings", or click "Configure Workspace Settings"
	Scroll down until you find "Deprecated and Restricted API"
	Change Forbidden Reference (Access Rules) to anything other than "Error", preferably "Ignore"
	
Step 2: Include the Resources folder into Build Path
	Right Click Resources folder > Build Path > Add to Build Path
