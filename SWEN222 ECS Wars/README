Setting up the Project Workspace for JavaFX:

Eclipse has some problems with the JavaFX library (which is a default part of Java 8)
so in order to correctly set up our work environment, we need to change some things.

Step 1: Disable Errors with restricted access
	Go to Project > Properties > Java Compiler > Errors/Warnings
	You may either check "Project specific settings", or click "Configure Workspace Settings"
	Scroll down until you find "Deprecated and Restricted API"
	Change Forbidden Reference (Access Rules) to anything other than "Error", preferably "Ignore"
	
Step 2: Include the Resources folder into Build Path
	Right Click Resources folder > Build Path > Add to Build Path
	
	
	
	
How to play:
	Use WASD to move around.
	Use Q and E to rotate view.
	Press + to zoom in and - to zoom out. (Note this refers to the keys along the top of the keyboard, not to the number pad ones.)
	Hold shift to sprint.
	Left-click to shoot.
	Right-click to interact with certain characters or pick up/interact with items.
	To use an item in your inventory, press the number key that corresponds to the inventory space.
	To get points from gems you have picked up, interact with a vanishing cabinet while the gems are in your inventory.
	To put items in a pouch, 'use' the pouch from your inventory, and right-click an inventory item to put it in the pouch.
	To drop an item, right-click it from your inventory.
	To put an item in a container, right-click the inventory item while a container is open.
	Key cards open locked doors.
	Torches can be used in dark places.
	Health rejuvenating items can be bought from certain NPCs by spending points.
